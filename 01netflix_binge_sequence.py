# Input
series_name = input("Enter the series name: ")
episodes_per_season = int(input("Enter episodes per season: "))
number_of_seasons = int(input("Enter number of seasons: "))
episode_length_minutes = int(input("Enter episode length in minutes: "))

# Calculations
total_episodes = episodes_per_season * number_of_seasons
total_minutes = total_episodes * episode_length_minutes
total_hours = total_minutes / 60
total_days = total_hours / 24
episodes_per_day = total_episodes / 7


# Output

print(f"That's {episodes_per_day:.1f} episodes per day to finish in one week!")
